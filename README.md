## Installation
In order to operate this application, the following dependencies will need to be installed via npm install:
- express
- dotenv
- mysql
- sequelize

The applications utilized for operation will be VScode and Insomnia, with a working mysql user name. 
The installation of all dependencies will be executed at the command line, as will access to MySQL.

## Usage
### User Story
```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
To further broaden the user base, as a back end developer I want a fully functioning back end 
that allows for quick updates to my application and the data stored within it, for which I am
able to easily view, add new entries, edit existing entries and delete unnecessary entries 
from my database.

## Contributing
The initial project was inheritance of a semi-functioning e-commerce website for which the back end required development in order to operate as intended. The implementation of a working database with multiple tables, routes as well as models for which Sequelize communicates with MySQL server for continual updates for addition and removal of data. In the process of implementing the backend I was assisted by TA Cody Wenrich-Clegg as a second set of eyes on a few roadblocks preventing data from updating in Insomnia.

## Tests
While resolving conflicts between the routes, the models and the database, testing was completed within Insomnia to ensure accurate functionality. The ability to perform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests were tested relentlessly until all end points satisfied the requirements per project parameters.
